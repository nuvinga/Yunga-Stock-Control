# Yunga Stocks- Stock Control System
## Under build using Java, JavaFx, MongoDB and Firebase-Authentication

Yunga Stocks is a desktop-based stock control application, which allows users to maintain a digital stock-book, simplifying the work of a ware-house to a simple stock-shop.

The primary aim of this build is to provide automated stock control application access to small scale shops which maintain manual stocks and go through quite some hardship
maintaining them.

This repo has not been updates for due to build purposes, however, I'd love to give you insight of the private repository of the application upon request.
